# 1. About Me

My undergraduate school is Tongji University, and my major is Civil Engineering, which is Top 1 in China. Then I worked as a senior civil engineer in one of the best 6 power design institute in China before 2018.

This excellent platform provided me the chance to manage many large international projects, such as projects in Russia, Bangladesh and so on. The complexity of large-scale international projects reinforced me with multicultural cooperation capability, project management capability and communication capability.

I am good at Information technology, like computer software and programming languages. I was the computer expert in my previous company, and I can use the tools developed by myself to greatly improve work efficiency.

Driven by intrinsic motivation in Data Science, I came to Hong Kong to read Master in Mathematics. I have a strong interest in data science and computer science, love to spend my free time playing data analysis and statistics, and earned a certificate in Machine Learning from Stanford University during my free time of master period.
