# 1. About Me

## 1.1. Education

My undergraduate school is Tongji University, and my major is Civil Engineering, which is Top 1 in China. Then I worked as a senior civil engineer in one of the 6-Best power design institute in China before 2018.

This excellent platform provided me the chance to manage many large international projects, such as projects in Russia, Bangladesh and so on. The complexity of large-scale international projects reinforced me with multicultural cooperation capability, project management capability and communication capability.

After working for so long a time, I decided to continue studying to improve myself. So I came to Hong Kong to read Master in Mathematics. After one year rigorous training in Mathematics, I feel that I am even better than before.

### 1.1.1. Mathematics

- Master of Science in Operational Research and Business Statistics, Double Master Degree, Hong Kong Baptist University.
- Master of Science in Business Analytics, Double Master Degree, University of Kent

Being loving data science for a long time, I finally made the decision, which is going to Hong Kong to learn Master of Science in Operational Research and Business Statistics. Now I am good at Data analysis, data mining, machine learning and business analysis.
