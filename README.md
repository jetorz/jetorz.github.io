# 1. About Me

My undergraduate school is Tongji University, and my major is Civil Engineering, which is Top 1 in China. Then I worked as a senior civil engineer in one of the 6-Best power design institute in China before 2018.

This excellent platform provided me the chance to manage many large international projects, such as projects in Russia, Bangladesh and so on. The complexity of large-scale international projects reinforced me with multicultural cooperation capability, project management capability and communication capability.

After working for so long a time, I decided to continue studying to improve myself. So I came to Hong Kong to read Master in Mathematics. After one year rigorous training in Mathematics, I feel that I am even better than before.

# 2. Work Experience

Senior Civil Engineer with advanced experience in full design process and highly complex projects. Profound knowledge in civil structure design and project management, including concept design, detail design, cost control, risk management, communication and cooperating with different functional teams and stakeholders.
